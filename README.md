# 2021 Bioinfomatics and Practice 1 -Term Project 


### Mission 1
Read count + Protein localization

Specificity of LIN28A targeting. mRNAs encoding integral membrane proteins are enriched in CLIP libraries (x axis) and affected most significantly in ribosome density upon Lin28a knockdown (y axis).



### Mission 2
Measuring Translational Efficiency after Depletion of Lin28a

Density of ribosome footprints near start and stop codons. All reads aligned to RefSeq transcripts (a nonredundant reduced set with only the longest isoforms) were merged. ‘‘0’’ represents the position of start (left) or stop (right) codons and indicated by red vertical lines.
